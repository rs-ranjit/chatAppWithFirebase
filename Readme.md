Firstly,
I made a context using the react native createContext which is wrapped in the context provider and the states can be used by every component without drilling the states.

And,
when the setIsAuthenticated is true home screen is shown. when it is false the Sign in page is shown

then,
I made the front end part where the icons are used using expo-vector-icons and the links are made using the useRouter of.

afterThat,
i made the loading animation using the lottifiles ,
made the interface using the keyboard view avoiding the view.
